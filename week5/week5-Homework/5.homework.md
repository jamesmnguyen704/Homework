- Find an API online from which you can consume data into your project (like the weather app, Google maps, or WebMD etc.) EG:- [Collection of Free Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#public-apis--)
- There is also a list of APIs that can be found in the [Addendum of Resources](../AddendumOfResources/index.md#apis-to-enhance-a-web-project)

### Homework Set-up

1. Add a "Week5-Homework" _folder_ to your homework repo
2. Inside the folder, create two additional folders:
   - "Andre-The-Giant"
   - "Array-Methods"
3. Inside the "Andre-The-Giant" _folder_, create `index.html` and `styles.css` files
4. Inside the "Array-Methods-Practice" _folder_, create `User.js`, `Todo.js` and `Post.js` files

An example of the file structure you should have for this assignment is

### CSS Media Queries Practice

**Section 1 of 3**

In the Section 5 Activities Folder, there is a folder called [5-Homework](https://github.com/savvy-coders/sc-curriculum/tree/master/Section05/Activities/5-Homework) that contains two files: `index.html` and `styles.css`.

The `index.html` file is a site about Andre the Giant while the `styles.css` file contains pre-existing styling for the site. Copy the contents of the files linked above into their respective files you created for the "Andre-The-Giant" _folder_ and then do the following:

In the `styles.css` file, fix the styling for the site, and create a media query that fixes the site to correctly display on the "iPhone 6/7/8" view in DevTools.

Focus on the following:

- The `#aboutMe` `<ul>` at the top of the page
- `<img>` tags
- `<div>` tags
- links

Please refer to the wireframe provided below as a visual guide for completing this assignment.

> TIP: In order to make sure your media query is functioning properly (i.e, the query triggers when expected), set up a simple css property inside your media query that changes the background color to blue _before_ you attempt to fix the styling. Use your dev tools in the browser to confirm that the background changes to blue when expected (iPhone 6/7/8 view) and THEN start working on the fixes. Don't forget to remove the background color property you made to test your media query!

> TIP: Open Google Chrome and navigate to the web page you want to inspect. Click on the toggle device toolbar icon. It looks like a small phone or tablet icon and can be found at the top-left corner of the Developer Tools pane. (You can also use Ctrl + Shift + M)
> Once the device toolbar is open, you'll see a dropdown menu where you can choose different device presets. To select iPhone 6/7/8, click on the dropdown and search for or scroll down to find the respective options.
> After selecting the desired device, the web page will be emulated as if it's running on the chosen device. You can also adjust the screen size and other parameters as needed.
> iPhone 6/7/8 dimensions: 375 x 667

### JS Array Methods Practice

<br>

**Section 3 of 3**

In your Week 5 Homework folder, create the following files:

- User.js
- Todo.js
- Post.js

In the User.js file, use the [placeholder User data](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) at [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) to:

- create and print a list of phone numbers
- create and print a list of website and email pairs (pair them in a string, array, or object)

<br>

In the Todo.js file, use the [placeholder To-Do data](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos?_limit=50) at [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos?\_limit=50](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos?_limit=50) to:

- create a list of user 3's to-dos
- then find the number of user 3's incomplete tasks

<br>

In the Post.js file, use the [placeholder Post data](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?_limit=50) at [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?\_limit=50](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?_limit=50) to:

- create a list of user 5's posts
- then, create a list of title and body pairs

<br>

<b>An example of the output you want is:</b>

```javascript
["1-770-736-8031 x56442", "010-692-6593 x09125"],
  [
    "hildegard.org, Sincere@april.biz",
    "anastasia.net, Shanna@melissa.tv",
    "ramiro.info, Nathan@yesenia.net",
  ][
    {
      userId: 9,
      id: 161,
      title: "ex hic consequuntur earum omnis alias ut occaecati culpa",
      completed: true,
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      userId: 5,
      id: 41,
      title: "non est facere",
      body:
        "molestias id nostrum\n" +
        "excepturi molestiae dolore omnis repellendus quaerat saepe\n" +
        "consectetur iste quaerat tenetur asperiores accusamus ex ut\n" +
        "nam quidem est ducimus sunt debitis saepe",
    },
  ],
  [
    {
      title: "non est facere",
      body:
        "molestias id nostrum\n" +
        "excepturi molestiae dolore omnis repellendus quaerat saepe\n" +
        "consectetur iste quaerat tenetur asperiores accusamus ex ut\n" +
        "nam quidem est ducimus sunt debitis saepe",
    },
  ];
```

## _Bonus Challenge_

Using the [placeholder To-Do data](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos?_limit=50) at [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos?\_limit=50](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos?_limit=50) :

- create an object that summarizes the incomplete tasks of users 1, 2, & 3

  - ex:

  ```javascript
  {
    user3: {
      totalTasks: x,
      totalIncomplete: y,
      incompleteTasks: [title1, title2, title3, ...]
    },
    user7: ...
  }
  ```
